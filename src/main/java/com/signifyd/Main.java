/*# Data has been exported from our legacy system.
# We now require this to be moved to S3 to be loaded into our Redshift data warehouse
# Write a script that will take the exported csv file provided and load it into S3

# Considerations
# The data in the file contains some incompatibilities with our redshift database you will need to fix these
#
# These are as follows:
# The date format is incompatible this should be changed to yyyy-MM-dd format.
# The amount column contains a special character which will need to be removed.
# Your code should reflect any considerations you see fit in terms of best practices and working with datasets at scale.

# Tips:
# Do not over engineer your solution! Be mindful of the time you have allocated, your task is to get the file into S3 in
# the correct format.

# I have provided 2 functions in the file S3_Util with the correct bucket to load the files into, you should be able to
# tweak one of these to your requirements to save you some time.*/
